# CAD_contest-2016
Static timing analysis (STA) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations.  STA breaks a design down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the input/output interface. We (Me and 3 friends) attended the CAD contest in 2016 and tried to address this problem.
-----

### Goal : 
  The goal is to develop an efficient STA program to find the true paths under a given multi-core computing environment.
  

### The Results:
The fourth rank among competitors
